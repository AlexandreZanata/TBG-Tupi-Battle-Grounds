//! Golden determinism guard (ARCHITECTURE §4, BR-M01–BR-M05). Three
//! bot-vs-bot matches with fixed seeds must end with exactly these state
//! hashes, outcomes, and ticks (the simulation is integer-only, so the
//! goldens must not depend on the platform). Any change to combat, targeting, synergies,
//! evolutions, the shop, or the bot moves a hash: if that change is
//! intended, record it in GAME-DESIGN (**Proposed**) and update the goldens
//! in the same commit; if not, it is a bug.
