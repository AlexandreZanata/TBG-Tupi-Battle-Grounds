# Game Design — Tupi Battle Grounds

> Authoritative game rules. Legacy rules are preserved from the archived
> design (sources S1–S5 below); MVP additions are marked **Proposed** and
> every number in §5 is a **new assumption** to be tuned by playtests.
> Technology lives in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), never here.

## 1. Identity and pillars

**Tupi Battle Grounds (TBG)** is an open-source, browser-first, real-time
1v1 strategy game: automatic combat on a single lane, a continuous
three-offer shop, branching unit evolution, and faction synergies. No
micromanagement — depth comes from what you buy, when you deploy, how you
evolve, and which factions you combine.

| # | Pillar (confirmed legacy, S1) |
|---|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Live 1v1 PvP: both players act simultaneously; the board evolves in real time |
| 2 | One `BattleLine`: no lateral movement |
| 3 | Automation: units move and fight without player input |
| 4 | Continuous `Shop`: offers rotate during combat; no preparation phase |
| 5 | Branching `Evolution` of deployed units |
| 6 | Faction `Synergy` bonuses |
| 7 | Authoritative server owns every competitive outcome |
| 8 | Free-to-play, cosmetics only; never pay-to-win |

## 4. How a match plays (MVP)

1. **Start.** Two players are paired. 3-second countdown; both start with
   the same `Energy` and their own three shop offers.
2. **Buy = deploy.** Tapping an affordable offer sends a `Purchase`
   intention. If valid, the unit spawns in front of the buyer's
   `Stronghold` and the offer refills. Rejections: insufficient `Energy`,
   slot cap reached, stale offer, match not running.
3. **Automatic combat.** Units walk toward the enemy `Stronghold`. A unit
   stops when its target is in range: the nearest enemy ahead (unit or
   `Stronghold`; ties broken by lowest unit id). It attacks on its
   cooldown. `Stronghold`s shoot the nearest enemy in range.
4. **Roles.** `Tank`: high HP, short range. `DPS`: high damage, fragile.
   `Ranged`: long range. `Support`: heals the lowest-HP% ally in range
   instead of attacking. `Control`: hits apply a status — *slow* (move
   and attack speed reduced) or *root* (cannot move or attack). Statuses
   do not stack; a new one replaces the old if stronger, else refreshes.
   *Splash* damages every enemy within a radius of the primary target.
5. **Evolve.** Tapping one of your living units opens its evolution
   choices. Tier 1 offers two branches; tier 2 offers the single upgrade
   that follows the chosen branch. Evolution is instant, costs `Energy`,
   and keeps the unit's current HP percentage.
6. **Synergy.** Each faction has bonuses at 2 and 4 living units of that
   faction (a two-slot unit counts as one unit). Bonuses apply to that
   faction's units only, recomputed every tick, preserving HP percentage.
7. **End.** Destroying the enemy `Stronghold` wins immediately. When
   regulation ends, the higher `Stronghold` HP wins; if tied, overtime
   starts with doubled `Energy` regeneration. A tie after overtime is a
   draw. A player who stays disconnected past the reconnect window
   forfeits. The result screen offers **Play again**.

## 5. MVP starting values (all **new assumptions**, tune via playtests)

Bot-harness balance pass of 2026-10-28 (P7) is applied below; human
playtests decide the final values (decision D-14).

Distances in tiles, times in seconds. The simulation stores them as
integers (see ARCHITECTURE.md §4).

| Constant | Value | | Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|-|----------|-------|
| BattleLine length (Stronghold to Stronghold) | 16 | | Countdown | 3 |
| Regulation | 180 | | Overtime | 60 |
| Energy start / cap | 5 / 10 | | Energy regen | 1 per ~1.76 s (17 sub-energy/tick; overtime 34) |
| Shop offers / full rotation | 3 / every 10 | | `SLOT_CAP` | 8 |
| Stronghold HP | 4500 | | Stronghold attack | 65 dmg / 1.0 s, range 6 |
| Evolution cost tier 1 / tier 2 | 3 / 4 | | Reconnect window | 30 |

**Starter roster (8 units, working names).** Two units per faction; every
archetype appears; two units use two slots.

| Unit | Faction | Archetype | Slots | Cost | HP | Dmg | Every (s) | Range | Speed | Special |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|------|----|-----|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| Shieldbearer | Humans | Tank | 1 | 3 | 650 | 30 | 1.2 | 0.8 | 0.8 | — |
| Archer | Humans | Ranged | 1 | 3 | 220 | 45 | 1.0 | 4.5 | 1.0 | — |
| Bone Brute | Undead | Tank | 2 | 4 | 1300 | 75 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 0.6 | — |
| Hexer | Undead | Control | 1 | 4 | 300 | 30 | 1.4 | 3.5 | 1.0 | slow 40% for 2 s |
| Sawbot | Machines | DPS | 1 | 3 | 270 | 55 | 1.05 | 0.8 | 1.3 | — |
| Siege Walker | Machines | Ranged | 2 | 5 | 700 | 85 | 2.5 | 6.0 | 0.6 | splash 1.5 |
| Bloomkeeper | Plants | Support | 1 | 3 | 280 | heal 40 | 1.5 | 3.0 | 0.9 | heals instead of attacking |
| Rootcaller | Plants | Control | 1 | 4 | 300 | 20 | 1.6 | 3.0 | 0.9 | root 0.8 s |

**Evolution trees** (`T1 → T2` per branch; modifiers stack on the base).

| Unit | Branch A | Branch B |
|------|----------|----------|
| Shieldbearer | Bulwark +50% HP → Fortress +50% HP, hits slow 30% 1.5 s | Vanguard +40% dmg, +20% speed → Champion +40% dmg, splash 1.0 |
| Archer | Longbow +1.5 range, +20% dmg → Marksman +60% dmg | Volley +40% attack speed → Arrow Rain splash 1.0 |
| Bone Brute | Ossified +50% HP → Bone Wall +50% HP, hits slow 30% 1.5 s | Butcher +50% dmg → Reaper +30% dmg, splash 1.2 |
| Hexer | Withering slow becomes 60% → Doom +60% dmg | Plague splash 1.0 → Pestilence splash 1.5, +40% dmg |
| Sawbot | Overclock +40% attack speed → Shredder +40% attack speed, +30% speed | Plating +60% HP → Juggernaut +60% HP, splash 0.8 |
| Siege Walker | Longshot +2 range → Artillery +50% dmg | Shrapnel splash +1.0 → Concussion hits root 0.8 s |
| Bloomkeeper | Blossom +50% heal → Grove heal splash 1.5 | Bramble +50% HP, gains 25 dmg attack → Thornwarden hits root 0.6 s |
| Rootcaller | Deep Roots root +0.6 s → Strangle +80% dmg | Spores splash 1.0 → Overgrowth +1 range, root +0.4 s |

**Synergies** (living units of the faction: 2 / 4).

| Faction | Bonus to that faction's units |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Humans | +20% / +40% max HP |
| Undead | +20% / +40% attack speed |
| Machines | +5% / +20% damage |
| Plants | regenerate 0.75% / 2% max HP per second |

## 6. Is it fun? (measured, not claimed)

Collected from bot-vs-bot runs (balance harness), match records, and
human playtests. Targets are starting hypotheses.

| Quality | Measure | Target |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Match length | Median duration | 2.5–4 min |
| Decisive play | Matches decided by Stronghold kill / overtime / draw | ≥ 60% / ≤ 30% / ≤ 2% |
| Decision frequency | Intentions per player per match | ≥ 25 (one every 4–7 s) |
| Strategic variety | Win rate of any faction-majority army (harness + humans) | 45–55% |
| Roster health | Purchase share of each unit | ≥ 5% |
| Counterplay | Every unit has a documented counter in the roster | 100% |
| Comebacks | Wins by the player behind in Stronghold HP at 2:00 | ≥ 20% |
| Readability | Testers can explain why they lost | ≥ 4 of 5 testers |
| Replayability | Testers pressing Play again after a match | ≥ 50% |

## 7. Deferred (rules kept, not in the MVP)

- `Reposition` intention: legacy names it but defines no semantics; with
  buy-to-deploy and automatic movement nothing is repositionable yet.
- Buying into a bench and deploying later (MVP merges buy and deploy).
- Shop reroll, offer weighting, duplicate rules.
- Cross-faction synergy combos (allowed by BR-Y01, none defined).
- Remaining 4 units of the 12-unit `MVPUnitRoster`.
- Accounts, `Inventory`, `Cosmetic` store, receipt validation (BR-C01–C03
  stay binding: nothing in the MVP may sell power).
- Ranking, rematch, spectating, replays, emotes, nicknames.

## 8. Retired technology decisions (game rules kept)

| Retired | Replaced by |
|---------|-------------|
| Unity C# client, native app stores | Rust/Bevy browser client (WASM/WebGL2) |
| Nakama + TypeScript match module | Rust authoritative server running `tbg-core` |
| PostgreSQL via Nakama | SQLite for MVP match records |
| Per-character MB-Lab/Mixamo rigging (ADR-003–006; ~8% auto pass rate, ADR-007) | Code-built rigid-part figurines with a shared animation library |
| StoreKit / Play Billing IAP | Deferred; cosmetics-only principle unchanged |
